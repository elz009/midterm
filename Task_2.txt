The git revert command is used to undo changes to a repository's commit history. It creates a new commit that inverses the changes specified, instead of deleting or orphaning commits in the commit history. This is a safer alternative to git reset in regards to altering shared history. git revert undoes a single commit, it does not "revert" back to the previous state of a project by removing all subsequent commits. Reverting has two important advantages over resetting. First, it doesn’t change the project history, which makes it a “safe” operation for commits that have already been published to a shared repository. Second, it allows you to undo changes that depend on other commits. To use git revert, you need to specify the commit you want to revert. The command creates a new commit that undoes the changes of the specific commit from your local repository. The syntax of the command is git revert <commit ID>. If you made several changes and have not committed them yet but decided to undo them, the git revert command cannot be used because it reverts a single commit. Instead, you can use the git reset command.
